** TODO intro to abstract algebra
*** TODO intuition abstract algebra
*** TODO list of algebraic structures with their axioms
** TODO category theory briefly ...
Constructive math

** TODO ml motivation
*** TODO ml is just optimization part 1
*** LOTS of publications right now about variants of continuous algorithms
- adding momentum
- making an algo /online/ or /block-seperable/
- variance reduction
- etc...
*** most of those papers are pretty systematic :
1. general /algebraic idea/ for algorithm modifications targetting certain metrics
2. Proof of /algorithmic bounds/ (in space or in time) under various invariants
3. Fast implementation in imperative language and empirical tests

- goal: automate all threeee

** TODO basics of AD and other approaches
*** implementations
- tensorflow / swift :  [[https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/DifferentiableProgramming.md][swift/DifferentiableProgramming.md at master · apple/swift · GitHub]]
- julia : zygote : [[https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl][GitHub - FluxML/Zygote.jl: Intimate Affection Auditor]]
